# Design — a self-owned replacement for Anki

**Status: design, not started.** Nothing here is built. This document exists to be
argued with before any code is written, and to be moved into the new repo as its
first commit once it is.

It lives in `ukrainian-anki-scanner/docs/` only because the new repo does not exist
yet. This scanner is the app being absorbed, so this is the closest thing to a home
it has today.

---

## 0. TL;DR

- Anki is already free and open source. The reason to replace it is **not cost** and
  **not the scheduler** — it is that the pipeline is one-way. Cards flow out to Anki
  and no review data ever comes back, so nothing upstream can know which words are
  actually sticking.
- The secondary reason is that roughly a third of this repo's complexity is **interop
  tax** — timestamped filenames, `.apkg`-vs-CSV, deterministic note-type ids, `#`-escaping
  — all of it there only to negotiate with a foreign app. Owning the review surface
  deletes it.
- The scope is a **PWA**: offline reviewer, FSRS scheduler, page scanner, pronunciation
  scoring, stats. One new repo. TypeScript everywhere that is hosted; one local Python
  CLI for migration.
- **FSRS is already enabled** in AnkiDroid, which means migration is a data copy rather
  than a reconstruction, and post-switch scheduling should be near-identical to today.
  This was the largest risk and it is retired.
- The safety property that makes this defensible: **`card_state` is a fold over an
  append-only `reviews` log.** Scheduling state is a cache, never the truth. Any bug,
  any bad migration, any FSRS upgrade — replay the log.
- **Build the migration spike first**, before any UI. It is the only step that can prove
  the whole idea impossible, it depends on none of the other decisions, and it is a day
  of work.

---

## 1. Why build this at all

### 1.1 The reasons that do not hold

Worth stating plainly so nobody re-litigates them later.

- **"Anki costs money."** It does not. Desktop is AGPL-3.0, AnkiDroid is GPL-3.0,
  AnkiWeb sync is free. The only fee anywhere is AnkiMobile on iOS, and this household
  is on Android.
- **"I want to stop depending on AnkiWeb."** Fair, but that is a config change, not a
  rewrite — Anki ships a self-hostable sync server and AnkiDroid accepts a custom
  endpoint. If that were the whole complaint, this project would not be justified.
- **"Anki is a simple program."** The reviewer is simple. Anki is not: a Rust core, a
  TypeScript reviewer, a Python/Qt desktop shell, a separate Kotlin Android app, a sync
  protocol, a template engine, and fifteen years of accumulated edge cases. Rebuilding
  *that* would be a multi-year mistake.

### 1.2 The reason that does hold

The pipeline is one-way and always has been:

```
bot  ─┐
      ├─► CSV / .apkg ─► AnkiDroid ─► (nothing)
scan ─┘
```

The bot's `flashcards` table is the proof:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "public"."flashcards" (
    "id" uuid, "user_id" uuid, "vocabulary_id" uuid,
    "example_message_id" uuid, "created_at" timestamptz
);
```

No `due`, no `stability`, no `lapses`, no review count. Every signal about what is
hard, what lapsed, and what stuck lives on a phone, inside an app that does not talk
back. `/recap` cannot know that a word keeps failing. `/learn` cannot know a word is
already mastered and stop re-adding it.

That is the capability being bought. Not a cheaper Anki — a **closed loop**.

### 1.3 The reason that makes it cheap

The note type in use is one card template, one direction, seven fields:

```
FRONT: {{lemma}}
BACK:  FrontSide + lemma_translation, gloss, part_of_speech,
       example, example_translation
```

No cloze, no reverse cards, no conditional sections, no image occlusion. The reviewer
being rebuilt is a `<div>` with one word in it, a tap, five more divs, and four buttons.
Anki's template engine is almost entirely unused.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Replaced

| Capability | Today | After |
|---|---|---|
| Daily review queue | AnkiDroid | PWA |
| Scheduling | FSRS in AnkiDroid | FSRS via a scheduler library, same parameters |
| Page scanning | Streamlit app → download → import | In-app, straight to the collection |
| Pronunciation | AnkiPA + Azure (English only) | Whisper-based, **works for Ukrainian** |
| Stats | Anki graphs | Read-only views over the review log |
| Sync | AnkiWeb | Append-only review log against Postgres |

### 2.2 Explicitly not replaced

**The Telegram bot pipeline does not change.** `/learn`, `/export`, `/pronounce`,
`/recap` keep working exactly as they do now. The bot keeps writing `flashcards` rows;
the new app simply also reads them. No change to `index.ts` is in scope.

### 2.3 Kept forever

**`.apkg` export stays.** It costs nothing — it is already written and tested — and it
is both the backup format and the escape hatch. As long as a current collection can be
exported back into real Anki, this project is never a bet that cannot be walked back.

---

## 3. Decisions

Locked unless revisited deliberately.

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Offline-first PWA | Matches how AnkiDroid is actually used — reviewing without signal. The single biggest driver of effort, and non-negotiable. |
| D2 | Cards shared, **scheduling per-person** | Two people's memories cannot share one interval. One pool of notes, `(note_id, user_id)` scheduling. Costs one column. |
| D3 | Migrate cards **and** review history | FSRS is on, so memory state ports directly. Mature cards stay mature. |
| D4 | Same Supabase project as the bot | One Postgres, so the feedback loop into `/recap` is later a join, not an integration. |
| D5 | One unified app, scanner included | Deletes the entire export/import surface. The reason the project is worth doing at all. |
| D6 | TypeScript for everything hosted | One language, one deploy target, one secret store. Reuses the Anthropic-from-Deno pattern already proven in the bot. |
| D7 | Python **only** for the migration CLI | Local tool, run a handful of times, never hosted. Gets the mature zip/SQLite/zstd stack for the one task where being wrong costs review history. |
| D8 | Image prep in the browser | Canvas resize before upload: ~1MB over mobile data instead of a 12MB camera original. Browsers apply EXIF orientation automatically, so the hand-rolled rotation goes away. |
| D9 | New third repo | Clean boundaries. Scanner and bot both feed it. |
| D10 | No ingest review step | Scan, extract, import. Fixing happens in the reviewer instead — see D11. |
| D11 | **Edit-in-place in the reviewer** | Consequence of D10. Without it there is no repair path at all — see §4.4. |
| D12 | Suspend / bury / delete mid-review | Cheap, and the first thing that gets reached for with LLM-generated cards. |
| D13 | Device token, not a login | Set once at install, lives in IndexedDB. Zero daily friction, works offline forever, and the collection is not world-readable — see §4.5. |
| D14 | Whisper scoring: right / close / wrong | Three buckets, honestly reflecting the precision the method has. |
| D15 | Parallel-run with AnkiDroid | Migration therefore must be **idempotent and re-runnable**, which constrains the schema. |
| D16 | Streamlit scanner stays alive until replaced | No capability gap during the build. |

### 3.1 Rules inherited from `capybara-bot`

The new app shares a Supabase project with the bot, so the bot's discipline applies:

- **No deploys without an explicit, in-the-moment request.** The maintainer runs every
  deploy. This has bitten before.
- **No Supabase changes** — migrations, SQL, dashboard — without the same explicit
  request. A migration for this app touches the live couple database.
- **No secrets in code or git.** Everything via environment, never hardcoded.
- **The repo is public.** No conversation content, no corpus content, no personal
  details. Code, docs and placeholders only.

```

Static hosting: Cloudflare Pages or Vercel. Free tier, HTTPS and service workers work
out of the box. Supabase Storage can serve static files but it is the awkward path.

### 4.1 Why the scanner's Python dissolves

`claude_parser.py` does four jobs. Three of them move:

- **Image prep** → the browser. Gets simpler; EXIF handling largely disappears.
- **The Claude call** → an edge function. `MODEL`, `MAX_TOKENS`, the prompt and the tool
  schema are all data. The Anthropic TypeScript SDK exposes the same error classes the
  Python currently catches, so the five failure branches map one-to-one, and truncation
  detection is the same `stop_reason` check.
- **Schema validation** → wherever the call lives.
- **Reading Anki collections** → stays in Python, as the migration CLI (D7).

The real cost of the port is the **test suite**: a mocked-transport suite covering
truncated responses, rejected keys, server errors and rate limits, needing no API key
and no network. It ports to Deno's test runner, but that is a day spent re-earning
coverage that already exists. Budget for it; do not pretend it is free.

One honest regression: browsers cannot decode HEIC, PIL with `pillow-heif` can. Android
cameras produce JPEG, so this likely never bites — but it is the one capability lost.

### 4.2 Why the review log is the sync primitive

The hard case for offline is not "no signal." It is **flaky** signal: half-sent batches,
duplicate submissions, an app killed mid-session, clock skew between phone and server.

Making reviews **append-only events with client-generated ids** collapses that entire
class of bug. Retries are idempotent upserts. A duplicate submission is a no-op. Two
devices never conflict, because a review is a fact about one person at one moment, not
a mutation of shared state.

This must be designed in from the first line. Bolting it onto a mutable `due` column
later is a rewrite.

### 4.3 Why `card_state` is a cache

`card_state` is derivable: replay `reviews` through FSRS and it reconstructs exactly.
It exists only so the due query is fast.

That property is the answer to the obvious objection — *what if my homegrown app eats
five years of review history?* It cannot, as long as the log is intact. A bad migration,
an FSRS version bump, a scheduling bug discovered in six months: delete `card_state`,
replay, correct again.

This is worth the extra table even though a mutable `due` column would work on day one.
Anki's real hidden value was never the scheduler; it was that the collection does not
rot. This is how that value gets replaced.

### 4.4 Why edit-in-place is not optional

D10 removes the ingest review step. D-nothing provides a Browse window. Without D11
there is **no way to fix a card** — only to delete it.

Walk it through: the model extracts a wrong-sense translation, which the bot's own
prompt has a whole paragraph fighting because it is the known failure mode. The card
lands. In the reviewer it can be suspended or deleted. Re-scanning the page runs the
same model over the same image and very likely reproduces the same error.

The fix is not a feature. Every field of a card is already being rendered in the
reviewer; make them editable in place. A text input and an `UPDATE`. It also happens
to be the same component that would later serve as a browse/edit surface if one is
ever wanted, so the feature cut in §3 comes back nearly free.

### 4.5 Why a device token rather than no auth

"No login" sounds like *protected by an unguessable URL*. With Supabase it is not: the
project URL and anon key ship inside the JavaScript bundle. Anyone who loads the page
has them. If row-level security is permissive enough for an unauthenticated app to read
cards, it is permissive for anyone who views source — to read, write and delete.

This matters more here than in most projects. The corpus is derived from two people's
private conversations. `PRIVACY.md` exists. The bot's `/bug` command is admin-only
specifically because the non-admin partner cannot judge where the text lands. A
world-readable collection would be the one soft spot in an otherwise careful system.

A device token preserves everything that was actually wanted — no login screen, no
magic links, no token expiry, works offline forever — and removes the hole. Paste a
secret once at install, store it in IndexedDB, send it with every request, validate it
at the edge function.

## 5. Data model

Sketch, not final. Column types elided where obvious.

```sql
-- Shared pool. Both users see every note.
notes (
  id            uuid primary key,
  anki_guid     text unique,      -- migration idempotency key (§7.2)
  lemma, gloss, lemma_translation,
  part_of_speech, language, example, example_translation,
  audio_url     text,
  source        text,             -- 'scan' | 'bot' | 'anki-import'
  created_at    timestamptz
);

-- Per-person. Never shared. A cache over `reviews` (§4.3).
card_state (
  note_id       uuid,
  user_id       uuid,
  due           date,
  stability     real,             -- FSRS memory state
  difficulty    real,             -- FSRS memory state
  state         smallint,         -- new | learning | review | relearning
  reps          integer,
  lapses        integer,
  suspended     boolean,
  primary key (note_id, user_id)
);

-- Append-only. The sync primitive (§4.2). Never updated, never deleted.
reviews (
  id            uuid primary key, -- client-generated → idempotent upsert
  note_id       uuid,
  user_id       uuid,
  rating        smallint,         -- 1..4
  reviewed_at   timestamptz,      -- client clock, when it happened
  elapsed_days  integer,
  scheduled_days integer,
  ingested_at   timestamptz default now()  -- server clock, when it arrived
);

-- Per-person. Lifted verbatim from AnkiDroid at migration (§7.3).
scheduler_config (
  user_id           uuid primary key,
  fsrs_params       real[],
  desired_retention real,
  learning_steps    integer[],
  daily_new_limit   integer,
  daily_review_limit integer,
  max_interval      integer
);
```

Two clocks on `reviews` is deliberate. `reviewed_at` is what FSRS needs — when the
recall actually happened. `ingested_at` is what debugging needs — when it reached the
server, which on a week-long offline stretch is very different.

---

## 6. Offline behaviour

| Situation | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Online, normal | Answer posts immediately, `card_state` updated server-side |
| Offline | Review appended to a local queue in IndexedDB, `card_state` updated locally so the session continues |
| Reconnect | Queue flushes as a batch; server replays through FSRS |
| Partial flush | Client-generated ids make the retry a no-op for whatever already landed |
| App killed mid-session | Queue is durable in IndexedDB; nothing is lost |
| Two devices, both offline | No conflict — the two users review disjoint decks (§9.1), and reviews are events, not mutations |

Audio is the bulk of offline storage and needs an explicit caching policy — see §11.

---

## 7. Migration

**Build this first (§9).** It is the only step that can prove the project impossible.

### 7.1 What is being read

A collection export is a zip containing a SQLite database. Modern Anki compresses it
(`collection.anki21b`, zstd) rather than shipping plain SQLite. This repo's existing
test suite already unzips an `.apkg` and reads its SQLite the way Anki would — but that
is the *older uncompressed* format genanki produces. A real phone export will likely
need a decompression step, or Anki's "support older Anki versions" export option.

**Verify against an actual export before promising anything here.** This is the single
largest unknown in the document.

### 7.2 Idempotency

D15 means migrating at least twice — once to try it, once at the real cutover. So
migration must never duplicate a card or clobber newer scheduling state.

The key is Anki's note GUID, which is stable across exports. Store it on `notes`, key
on it, and re-running becomes safe by construction.

This repo already solved the same problem once, in the other direction: note identity
is derived from lemma + part-of-speech rather than hashing every field, precisely so a
re-export updates a note instead of importing a second one.

### 7.3 What to extract beyond cards

FSRS being enabled means each card carries memory state that ports directly. Equally
important, and easy to forget:

- the FSRS parameter vector — **read its length from the collection, do not assume a
  count; it varies by FSRS version**
- desired retention
- learning steps
- daily new and review limits
- maximum interval

Those five settings *are* the felt experience of a day's reviews. Perfect card data with
wrong limits will feel wrong.

### 7.4 Output

The CLI does not write to Postgres. It emits files, and prints a report: how many notes,
how many cards, date range of the review log, anything it could not parse. Reading is
separable from writing, and the first run should be a read-only question — *what is
actually in here?* — not a mutation of the live couple database.

---

## 8. Pronunciation

This is the one place the new app **beats** Anki rather than matching it.

AnkiPA is a client for Azure Pronunciation Assessment. Azure has no `uk-UA` phoneme
model, so Ukrainian cannot be scored there at all — and that is half the household.
(`ru-RU` is on Azure's list and is deliberately not a substitute: different phoneme
inventory, so the scores would be noise.)

Not being bound to Azure means Whisper transcription compared against the target text
gives a real signal for Ukrainian today. Cruder than phoneme assessment — which is why
the output is **three buckets, not a percentage** (D14). A 0–100 number would imply a
precision transcription-versus-target does not have.

The existing `scripts/anki_pronunciation/` in the bot repo already generates reference
audio via ElevenLabs. That stays as-is; only the scoring side is new.

---

## 9. Build order

Scope is everything-at-once. Order still matters, because the ordering is what makes
the risk survivable.

| Step | What | Why here |
|---|---|---|
| **0** | Migration spike — read an export, print a report | Only step that can prove the idea impossible. Depends on no other decision. One day. |
| 1 | Schema + review log + FSRS replay, server-side | The durability property (§4.3) has to exist before anything writes reviews. |
| 2 | Reviewer: due queue, four buttons, suspend/delete, **edit-in-place** | The daily loop. Usable at this point, online-only. |
| 3 | Offline: service worker, IndexedDB, queued reviews | Turns it into something that replaces AnkiDroid rather than supplements it. |
| 4 | Real migration, run for real | Now there is somewhere for the data to land. |
| 5 | Scanner: camera, canvas resize, `/scan` edge function | Deletes the export/import tax (§1.2). |
| 6 | Pronunciation, stats | Genuinely separable; neither blocks daily use. |

Step 0 before anything else is the whole point. A day of work that either de-risks the
project or saves a month.

---

## 10. Non-goals

Stated so they do not creep in:

- **Multi-tenant.** Two users, one database, same as the bot.
- **A Browse window.** Edit-in-place (§4.4) is the repair path.
- **Anki's template engine**, cloze, image occlusion, reverse cards. Unused today.
- **Add-on support.** No plugin API, ever.
- **Replacing AnkiWeb sync generally.** Sync here is one household's review log, not a
  general-purpose collection merge. This is why it is tractable.
- **Changing the Telegram bot.** §2.2.
- **Desktop-first anything.** The phone is the review surface.

---

## 11. Open questions

Not blocking the migration spike; blocking step 1.

1. **Audio offline caching.** Reference recordings are the bulk of storage. Cache every
   card's audio, only due cards, or fetch on demand and accept silence offline? Needs a
   size estimate against the current collection before deciding.
2. **Backfilling the bot's existing rows.** Do historical `flashcards` rows become
   `notes`, or only new ones from the switch forward? Affects whether migration has two
   sources to reconcile or one.
3. **Day boundaries.** Both users are in one timezone but review at very different
   hours. Anki uses a configurable "next day starts at" rollover. What is it set to
   today, and does the same value carry over?
4. **What `language` means for queue filtering.** The decks are effectively disjoint by
   language (§9.1 assumption), but that is an assumption, not a constraint — nothing
   currently stops a note being relevant to both users.
5. **Repo name.** `capybara-cards` is proposed, to sit alongside `capybara-bot`. Not
   locked.

---

## 12. Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Collection export cannot be read or parsed | **Project-ending** | Step 0, before anything else is built |
| Homegrown app loses review history | High | Append-only log (§4.3); `.apkg` export kept forever (§2.3) |
| Offline sync bugs eat reviews silently | High | Client-generated ids, durable IndexedDB queue, idempotent ingest |
| Scheduling feels subtly wrong after the switch | Medium | Port all five config values, not just card data (§7.3) |
| Bad cards accumulate with no repair path | Medium | D11, edit-in-place |
| Collection exposed publicly | Medium | D13, device token (§4.5) |
| Project stalls half-built, leaving nothing usable | Medium | Build order (§9) — usable at step 2, replaces AnkiDroid at step 3 |
| A migration breaks the live couple database | High | CLI emits files, never writes (§7.4); no Supabase changes without explicit request (§3.1) |

### What would make us stop

If step 0 shows the collection cannot be read reliably, or that FSRS memory state is not
recoverable — stop. The fallback is not a rewrite: it is self-hosting Anki's sync server
and periodically importing an export into Postgres for the feedback loop, which delivers
§1.2's actual goal for a fraction of the work.

---

## Appendix — what this deletes from the scanner

For scale, the parts of this repo that exist **only** because Anki is a separate app:

- Timestamped filenames, to dodge Android Chrome's "Download file again?" dialog
- Two export buttons, because AnkiDroid registers for `.apkg` but not `text/csv`
- Deterministic note-type and deck ids, to avoid accumulating `Capybara-a3f1` copies
- Quoting every field so a lemma beginning with `#` is not eaten as an import directive
- Collapsing newlines, because Anki reads one note per line
- Overriding genanki's field-hash note identity with lemma + part-of-speech

None of it is wasted work — it is all correct, and it is all load-bearing today. It is
just tax on handing files to a program that cannot be changed. When the scanner writes
rows instead of files, all of it goes away.
